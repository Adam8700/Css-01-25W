For My project i have created my own trading card buisness called pokevault! to make the website feel like a real trading card site i have used some javascript to make some of the product pages feel real! I also used JS to load the header dynamically across all pages.
I wanted to give the a shopping cart icon at the top to feel like you are actually shopping, it it clickable but it just takes you to shop.html
